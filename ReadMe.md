## Clustering 
---
**Description of Dataset:**

*   The dataset includes details about everything people bought from a UK-based online store over the span of eight months including productID, product descriptions and Country.
*  Objective is to explore clustering approaches.

Consider the following two features [Product_Count, 'Product_UnitPrice'] for the following tasksâ€“
1. **K-Means Clustering:** Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm on the online retail data. Determine the optimal number of clusters using appropriate methods. Interpret and discuss the results obtained from K-Means clustering.

2. **K-Medoids Clustering:** Apply the K-Medoids clustering algorithm to the same online retail data. Explain the differences between K-Means and K-Medoids algorithm results. Evaluate the effectiveness of K-Medoids in clustering the online retail data.

3. **DBSCAN Clustering:** Implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm on the online retail dataset. Discuss the parameters used for DBSCAN and their impact on the results. Compare and contrast DBSCAN with K-Means and K-Medoids in the context of online retail data.
